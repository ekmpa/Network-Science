Exploration of algorithms on graphs, visualized in Python.

See demos [here](https://ekmpa.github.io/Network-Science/).

Next to do: 
- Pointing out, in a graph, the GCC, any cliques, bridges, scc/wcc
- Different centrality measures
- Diffusion simulator / SIR model
- Link prediction (visualize the performance w green v. red edges)
- DeepWalk?
